# Overview

Welcome to the Inventory Management System! This software module is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in the C++ programming language. As a software engineer student, my goal is to continuously enhance my skills and understanding of programming languages and their application in real-world scenarios.

This Inventory Management System allows users to manage a list of items in a virtual inventory. Each item is characterized by its name, SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), description, price, and quantity. The software provides functionalities such as adding new items, updating existing items, removing items, updating quantities, generating inventory reports, searching for items by name, and filtering items by description.

The purpose of developing this software is twofold: Firstly, it serves as a platform for deepening my understanding of essential C++ programming concepts. These include mastering data structures like structs and vectors, refining skills in input/output handling using file streams and console input, becoming proficient in error handling techniques, and mastering string manipulation methods. Secondly, this project aims to showcase my capability to implement fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a console-based application. By demonstrating effective management of data, implementation of algorithms, and navigation of software complexity, this endeavor underscores my growth as a software engineer committed to continuous learning and improvement.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I utilized several tools and resources to facilitate an efficient workflow. The primary programming language chosen for this project is C++11, selected for its robust features and versatility in handling data structures and low-level system operations. Throughout the development process, I leveraged various libraries and standard components of C++, including <iostream> for input/output operations, <fstream> for file handling, <sstream> for string manipulation, <vector> for dynamic array storage, and <algorithm> for generic algorithms.

The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding and debugging was Visual Studio Code, configured with C++ extensions for syntax highlighting, IntelliSense for code completion, and integrated debugging tools. This setup provided a streamlined environment for writing, testing, and refining the software. Git version control system was employed to manage code versions and collaborate seamlessly across different development stages. Additionally, the software was tested extensively on macOS using the Zsh shell terminal environment to ensure cross-platform compatibility and robust performance.
